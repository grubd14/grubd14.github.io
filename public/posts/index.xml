      <description>Neovim Neovim is a great piece of software if you are looking for an alternative to vim. Neovim is a fork of Vim with more features as well as bugs. But neovim community is very active so must of the bugs are fixed quickly. Neovim is in eary stages. Stable version 0.5.1 was relased recently which brings great features like native LSP and support for lua scripting language. Neovim has transitioned away from vimscript which is quite slow compared to lua.</description>
